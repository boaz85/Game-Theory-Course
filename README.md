# Game Theory Course - Final Project

Parts A and B are located in [this PDF](https://github.com/boaz85/Game-Theory-Course/blob/master/PartsA_B.pdf).

The programming part is a Jupyter notebook, containing experiments on populations of learning agents playing games.  
[Here](https://github.com/boaz85/Game-Theory-Course/blob/master/LearningAgents.ipynb) is the rendered notebook file with introduction and code. 
Notice the explaination texts above each code cell.  
  
You can also [click here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/boaz85/Game-Theory-Course/blob/master/LearningAgents.ipynb) to actually run it on Google Colab.  
It is recommended to choose GPU hardware accelerator under the runtime type settings.
